# Installing the requirements
1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
2. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (comes with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)).
3. Install [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html#download-links) (open a terminal and type `npm install -g typescript`).

# Cloning the project
1. Open a terminal and type `git clone URL`. **Replace URL with repository link you want to contribute to** e.g. `git clone https://github.com/PreMiD/PreMiD`.
2. Choose a folder of your choice.
3. Open it in your code editor.

# Installing dependencies
> Be sure you have installed [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager) first. It automatically installed itself if you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. 
> 
> {.is-warning}

- Open a terminal in your repository and type `npm i`.
- To update the dependencies type `npm update`.

> Be aware that updating the dependencies could break a lot, or not - testing is required!
