Version `2.x` introduces the [Presence Store](https://premid.app/store). Users now have the ability to manually add and remove their favourite presences through the user interface of the [website](https://premid.app/).

> Before getting started, it is highly recommended that you look at our presence guidelines.

# Structure

All Presences are made using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) has some extra spicy type definitions over JavaScript, so fixing and identifying bugs is way easier.

## 요구사항

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
2. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (comes with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/))

## Presence 복사하기

1. Open a terminal and type `git clone https://github.com/PreMiD/Presences`.
2. 원하는 폴더를 선택하세요.
3. 이것을 당신의 코드 편집기로 실행하세요.

## Getting started

1. Open a new terminal in the `Presences` folder
2. Install repository dependencies using `npm i` (Or your package manager of choice)

### Creating a Presence
1. Run `npx pmd` (or run `pmd` with the package manager of your choice)
2. Select the first option
3. Fill in all prompted questions

### Compiling / Modifying a Presence
1. Run `npx pmd`
2. Select the second option
3. Enter the Presence name you want to edit > This will start a TypeScript compiler in that Presence's folder, now when you edit the `presence.ts` it will automatically compile the presence for you.

For inspiration or examples on how to structure your Presence's code, take a look at existing Presences like 1337x or 9GAG

For more information about the `Presence` class click [here](/dev/presence/class).

Since v2.2.0 there are now Slideshows, this allows you to show multiple `PresenceData` interfaces on an interval, for more information click about the `Slideshow` class [here](/dev/presence/slideshow).

## Can't get certain data?!

A lot of websites are using [iframes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe) ([Inlineframes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Frames)). These html tags can contain multiple sources such as videos. But they're not relevant every time. Some are hidden or just not actively used. Check if you can extract the information you need without them before you do unnecessary work.

1. Check for them in your browsers console (be sure that you are on the **Elements** tab).
2. Search (<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> (Windows) or <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> (MacOS)).
3. Execute `document.querySelectorAll("iframe")`.

If you find that your data is in a iFrame you need to do the following:

1. Create a `iframe.ts` file.
2. Set iFrame to `true` in your metadata file.
3. Filling in your iFrame file.

```ts
const iframe = new iFrame();
iframe.on("UpdateData", async () => {
  //Get all the data you need out of the iFrame save them in variables and then send them using iframe.send
  iframe.send({
    //sending data
    video: video,
    time: video.duration
  });
});
```

4. Making your presence file receive data from the iFrame file.

```ts
presence.on("iFrameData", (data) => {
  iFrameVideo = data.video;
  currentTime = data.time;
});
```

**Note:** This needs to be placed outside of the updateData event.

# Loading your Presence

1. Open the extension popup in the browser and hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> button on your keyboard.
2. **Load Presence** will appear in the Presences section.
3. Click on it while you are still holding the <kbd>Shift</kbd> button.
4. Select the /dist folder of your presence.

# Some helpful things

## Hot-reloading

The website you are developing on is automatically reloading every time you save a file in your folder.

## Debugging

- You can put `console.log("Test");` between your code and see if your browser console gives you that output. If yes then go on and try again after the next function. If not then there is an error above.
- If that doesn't help you either then ask a presence developer on our [Discord server](https://discord.premid.app/) for help.
