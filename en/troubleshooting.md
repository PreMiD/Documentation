# General troubleshooting

### Reload the page

You can press <kbd>CTRL+R</kbd>/<kbd>F5</kbd> (Windows) or <kbd>CMD+R</kbd> (MacOS) on your keyboard too instead of searching for the refresh button.

### Make sure that you have enabled Activity Status in your Discord app settings

**User Settings** > **Activity Status**

### Restart your browser

<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F4</kbd> (Windows) or <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> (MacOS) does a good job too. (You have to start your browser again obviously.)

### Disable your extensions

Disable all your extensions and see if it works.
If yes, try to enable your extensions step-by-step and tell us which extension broke PreMiD.

# Common Issues

### Status Stuck

If your status appears to be stuck, try these steps in order:

1. Reload the tab
2. Close the tab
3. Restart your browser
4. If the issue persists, wait 20 minutes for it to clear automatically

Note: If you've uninstalled the extension, your status may remain stuck for up to 20 minutes before clearing.

### Presence Not Showing

If a specific presence is not showing up, this is most likely an issue with the presence itself. Please report this to the presence author by creating a new issue on GitHub:
[Report Presence Bug](https://github.com/PreMiD/Presences/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug,needs+repro&projects=&template=bug_report.yml)

### Missing Profile Decorations

If the profile decorations disappear from your profile, this is a temporary Discord bug and not related to PreMiD. The decorations should return on their own - there's nothing that needs to be fixed on our end.
