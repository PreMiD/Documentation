The installation of the extension is very important as the application can not do anything by itself.

2. Choose **Firefox**.
3. Search for ``about:addons``.
4. Click on the small gear icon in the upper right corner.
5. Choose **Install add-on from file**.
6. Select the file you downloaded recently.
7. Accept the installation by clicking on **Add**.

> Do not forget to [add the **application**](/install).
